## Brand & Style

The design system is engineered for maximum utility and legibility in high-glare, outdoor environments typical of rural Indian agriculture. The brand personality is **Dependable, Empathetic, and Accessible**. It prioritizes functional clarity over decorative flair, ensuring that farmers of varying literacy levels and digital proficiency can navigate critical procurement and registration workflows with confidence.

The visual style is a hybrid of **Modern Corporate** and **High-Contrast Minimalism**. It utilizes the structural logic of Material Design 3 but strips away complex shadows and subtle gradients that often disappear on low-budget, low-nit mobile displays. The aesthetic is defined by "Pictorial-First" communication—using large, recognizable metaphors and high-visibility color blocks to guide the user through offline-capable task flows.

## Colors

The palette is optimized for **outdoor visibility**.
- **Primary (Deep Green):** Represents trust and agriculture. Used for top bars, primary buttons, and successful state indicators. It provides a strong contrast against white backgrounds.
- **Secondary (Bright Yellow):** Used for attention-grabbing elements, warnings, and active stepper icons. It is chosen for its cultural resonance with growth and its high visibility in sunlight.
- **Tertiary (Mint White):** A very soft green-tinted white used for large card surfaces to reduce eye strain while maintaining high contrast with text.
- **Surface & Background:** High-purity white (#FFFFFF) is used for the primary background to ensure the best possible screen reflection management.

## Typography

The typography system uses **Be Vietnam Pro** for its modern, friendly, and geometric structure in English titles, paired with **Noto Sans** for its exceptional multi-script support (specifically Devanagari/Hindi). 

Key rules:
- **Oversized Defaults:** Standard body text starts at 16px, with 18px preferred for critical instructions to assist users with varying visual acuity.
- **Weight as Hierarchy:** Since color is used sparingly for functional states, font weight (Bold/Medium) is the primary tool for distinguishing headers from body text.
- **Line Height:** Generous line heights are maintained to prevent crowding, which is essential for Hindi script legibility where vowel signs (matras) appear above and below the base characters.

## Layout & Spacing

This design system uses a **Fluid Grid** model optimized for the vertical orientation of mobile devices. 
- **Touch Targets:** A minimum touch target of 56px (height and width) is enforced for all interactive elements to accommodate "fat-finger" errors and shaky-hand usage in field conditions.
- **Safety Margins:** A 20px outer margin ensures content does not get clipped by budget phone screen protectors or thick protective cases.
- **Vertical Stack:** Navigation is strictly vertical. Horizontal scrolling is avoided to prevent confusion regarding "hidden" content.
- **Progress Tracking:** Vertical steppers should occupy the full width of the screen, providing a clear top-to-bottom "path" for multi-step registration or booking processes.

## Elevation & Depth

To accommodate low-end hardware and maximize battery efficiency, this design system avoids complex drop shadows. 
- **Tonal Layers:** Depth is expressed through **Surface Tiers**. The base layer is white, while interactive cards use the Tertiary Mint White (#E8F5E9) with a thin 1px stroke in Primary Green (#004D40) at 20% opacity.
- **Zero-Shadow Content:** Instead of elevation shadows, active states are indicated by a **High-Contrast Border** (2px) in Secondary Yellow or a solid Primary Green background.
- **Modal Overlays:** Use a solid 60% black scrim to pull focus, ensuring the modal content has a sharp, solid white background.

## Shapes

The shape language uses **Level 2 (Rounded)** settings. 
- **Standard UI Elements:** Use 0.5rem (8px) corner radii. This provides a friendly, modern feel that aligns with Material 3 without looking too "playful" or childlike.
- **Pictorial Buttons:** Large action tiles use 1rem (16px) rounding to clearly distinguish them from smaller informational cards.
- **Input Fields:** Use "Sturdy" 8px rounding with a visible 1.5px border to clearly define the input area.

## Components

### Pictorial Buttons (Primary Interaction)
These are the core of the navigation. Each button features a large, simplified icon (2-color flat style) on the left or top, accompanied by a bold Label-LG text. They must have a minimum height of 80px.

### Vertical Stepper
The stepper uses the Secondary Yellow for the "Active" node and Primary Green for "Completed" nodes. Lines between nodes are 4px thick to ensure visibility.

### Action Cards
Cards containing procurement data or slot details should use a "Container-First" approach. Use the Primary Color for the header of the card and a high-contrast black on Tertiary White for the content body.

### Input Fields
Fields must include a persistent label above the input and a "Hint" text below it. Underline-only inputs are prohibited; use full-box inputs with clear borders.

### Progress Visualizers
Linear progress bars should be 12px thick (taller than standard) and use the Secondary Yellow for the progress fill against a Primary Green background, ensuring the bar is visible even in direct sunlight.

### Status Badges
Chips/Badges use high-contrast color fills: Green for "Paid/Success," Yellow for "Pending/Waiting," and Red for "Action Required."
